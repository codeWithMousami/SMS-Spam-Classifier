# SMS-Spam-Classifier


I've just completed work on an hashtag#SMSSPAMCLASSIFIER. 
Here's a quick overview of the project journey:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning: We started by cleaning the raw SMS data, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
2️⃣ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Next, we dove deep into the data, uncovering insights and patterns to understand the nature of spam messages.
3️⃣ Text Preprocessing: Preparing the text data involved various steps like tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming to make it suitable for model training.
4️⃣ Model Building: Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I constructed models to classify SMS messages as spam or not.
5️⃣ Evaluation: Rigorous testing and evaluation were conducted to assess the performance of each model.
6️⃣ Improvement: Constant refinement and tuning were performed to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.
7️⃣ Website: To make the classifier accessible, I've developed a website where users can input their messages and get instant classification results.
After thorough experimentation, I found that Naive Bayes algorithm outperformed others, delivering the highest accuracy.
